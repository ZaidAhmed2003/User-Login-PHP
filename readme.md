# User Login System with PHP, PDO, and AJAX

This project demonstrates a simple user login system implemented using PHP for server-side processing, PDO for secure database interactions, and AJAX for asynchronous requests to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used:

- **PHP with PDO:**

  - Used for server-side scripting and secure database interactions.
  - PDO provides a flexible and secure way to interact with databases.
  - Prepared statements and parameterized queries are employed to prevent SQL injection.

- **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):**
  - Used to perform asynchronous requests to the server without reloading the entire page.
  - Enhances user experience by providing a seamless login process.
